                    <p>Following the Easter incident, a group of Sri Lanka's 
                        private tourist industry founded the Sri Lanka tourist Alliance. 
                        The introduction of the Love Sri Lanka website in May sparked an
                         outpouring of popular support and #love. The Alliance has established 
                         an industry-wide Resilience Action Plan and Crisis Response Plan, 
                         as well as a new consumer website to encourage tourism to Sri Lanka. 
                         The Alliance exemplifies the enormous amount that can be accomplished
                          when individuals work together.

                          And every place and area that we describe on our website are the private sectors that collaborate with us.
